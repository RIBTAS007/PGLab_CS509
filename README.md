## General Guidelines on how you can execute the output files.

I have used Linux Mint 20 "Ulyana" for executing my files and writing my code in C/C++

1. Go to the folder where the output file is present. Make sure to keep other files also in the same folder which you will need for taking the input.(eg Data.txt file)

2. Open terminal using `ctrl+ alt + T` and come to the folder where the output file is present.

3. type "`./solution.o`" to execute the C/C++ code.

4. Give the inputs to the file accordingly and execute it. In case, pressing enter does starts execution after giving input, you can press `Ctrl + D` to execute the file.
